## Crop bars on screenshots

The program crops redundant upper and lower bars on screenshots (*.png files with 2880x1800), then resize them. Adjusted to the Macbook resolution 2880x1800.
<p>Also resizes ordinary images (.bmp, .jpeg, .jpg, .png) to default.
<p>All images (only images!) are saved into the new folder named as initial folder + '_cropped'.
